## how to run the code?

1. ```  cd '{target directory}'   ```

2. ```  pip install -r ./requirements.txt   ```

3. ```  python main.py   ```

4. ```  python JSON_.py   ```

## what does these code do?

1. **main.py**: a. This demo will randomly generate items for testing. b. This demo will check whether the input name exists or not automatically (under current folder) c. Generated data will be appended into an existing file, or created a new file.


2. **JSON_.py**: After creating or adding tickets, you might wanna detect incomplete tickets. Simply run:  ```  python JSON_.py   ```.

3. I applied two third party libraries: ```names``` and ```phone_gen```, which are used to generate random names and phone numbers.
